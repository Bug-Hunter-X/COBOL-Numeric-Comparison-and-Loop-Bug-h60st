This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in COBOL related to numeric comparisons and a potential infinite loop. The program initializes two numeric variables and then uses conditional statements to check for specific conditions. However, an improper use of comparison operators could lead to unexpected behavior or infinite loops. The solution provides a corrected version with improved handling of the comparison logic and loop conditions.
